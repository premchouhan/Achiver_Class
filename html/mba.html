        <p>MBA is one of the most popular post-graduate courses in India and abroad. For most of the managerial level
            jobs across domains and sectors an MBA degree is a necessity which is why, nowadays a large number of BTech,
            BBA, BCom, BA, BSc, BCA graduates opt for MBA in post graduation.
